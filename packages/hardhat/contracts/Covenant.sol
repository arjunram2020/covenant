/**
 * @title Covenant
 * @notice Milestone-based USDC escrow with explicit acceptance criteria,
 *         optionally reviewer-gated releases, and donor refunds.
 *
 * All value flows in USDC (an ERC-20 with 6 decimals); every amount in this
 * contract is denominated in USDC base units. Donors must approve() this
 * contract before donating.
 *
 * Flow per milestone:
 *   1. Donors send USDC into escrow via donate() (after approving it).
 *   2. Once donations cover the milestone, the creator submits a proof
 *      package via submitProof(). This does NOT release funds.
 *   3. The campaign's configured approvers evaluate the proof against the
 *      milestone's acceptance criteria and approve or reject it. Funds
 *      release only when the approval threshold is met. On rejection the
 *      creator revises and resubmits; escrow stays locked.
 *
 * Approval authority is configured per campaign:
 *   - WeightedApproval: any donor may vote, weighted by how much USDC they've
 *     personally donated to this campaign (capped per voter at
 *     MAX_VOTER_WEIGHT_BPS of the snapshot taken at submission time);
 *     releases once the approving weight reaches the campaign's configured
 *     percentage of that snapshot AND at least MIN_WEIGHTED_APPROVERS
 *     distinct donors have voted yes. This does not make Sybil resistance
 *     absolute — it raises the cost from "one wallet" to "several
 *     well-funded wallets" (see docs/CONTRACT_SECURITY_REVIEW.md).
 *   - DesignatedReviewers: an explicit reviewer set + threshold (committee
 *     when threshold > 1).
 *   - PlatformOperator: the contract owner (grant administrator / platform).
 *
 * Evidence privacy boundary: the chain stores a short public summary plus a
 * keccak256 hash of the full proof-package manifest (and, only when the
 * creator opts in, a public manifest URI). Sensitive raw evidence is never
 * required to live on-chain; the hash lets any reviewer verify an off-chain
 * package byte-for-byte.
 *
 * Failure handling: each milestone can carry a proof deadline. If the
 * creator misses it (or reviewers go silent past a grace window), anyone can
 * cancel the campaign and every donor can reclaim their share of the
 * unreleased escrow. A milestone can only release from this campaign's own
 * donations (totalReleased + amount <= totalRaised), so one campaign can
 * never be paid out of another campaign's escrow.
